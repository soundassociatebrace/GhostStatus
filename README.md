**GhostStatus** is a lightweight desktop application for players of **League of Legends**, **VALORANT**, and **Legends of Runeterra** who want more flexible control over their online/offline/“away” status and personal space.  

The app is distributed as a **`.zip` archive** with **a single executable `.exe` file inside**.  
You download the archive → enter the access key → run `GhostStatus.exe` → and a small icon appears in your system tray, letting you switch how your status is shown.

## 🧩 What is this file and what is it for?

Inside the **GhostStatus** archive you’ll find:

- 💾 **one executable file**: `GhostStatus.exe` (a portable Windows application).

The application allows you to:

- launch supported Riot games with a chosen status mode (for example, appearing “offline” or “mobile” in the friends list);
- switch how you appear via a **system tray icon** (Windows notification area);
- play, chat in lobbies, and queue up while keeping a more private presence in the client.

It’s useful if you:

- sometimes want to play without constant “why don’t you invite me?” messages;
- enjoy **calm solo sessions** but don’t want to completely hide your friends list;
- value **flexible presence management**, not just the default client options.

> GhostStatus is positioned as a **privacy and presence‑management helper**. Use it responsibly and in accordance with the rules of the games and services you use.

## 🚀 Advantages over other solutions

Why **GhostStatus** can become your main tool for managing your online presence:

- 🧭 **Focused on Riot games**  
  Supports the main Riot client games (League of Legends, VALORANT, Legends of Runeterra), taking into account how each handles presence.

- 🪟 **Handy tray icon**  
  After launch, the app minimizes to the notification area:  
  one click – and you switch modes (online / offline‑style / mobile, etc.).

- 💼 **Single `.exe`, no installer**  
  No complex installers or extra setup:  
  download `.zip` → extract → run `GhostStatus.exe` → use it.

- 🧩 **Subtle, unobtrusive design**  
  The app stays out of your way while you play — it quietly runs in the background without intrusive windows.

- 🕹 **Good for both solo and team play**  
  You can play with friends, chat in lobbies, and still avoid looking “hard online” to your entire friends list.

## 🎯 Why *you* might want to download this file

**GhostStatus** is especially useful if:

- 😌 You want to play **without feeling “obligated” to everyone**  
  Sometimes you just want to log in, play a couple of games, and log out — without the expectation that you’ll instantly join a stack.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 You have a large friends list  
  There’s always someone who sees you online and immediately invites you to a lobby. GhostStatus gives you more control over how you appear.

- 🎙 You’re a streamer or content creator  
  During recording, filming, or testing it’s convenient when not everyone on your friends list sees that you’re in‑game.

- 📅 You mix gaming with other tasks  
  Sometimes you open the client “in between things” — with GhostStatus you don’t have to look like you’re fully available for games.

If you’ve ever thought: *“It would be nice if the client thought one thing, but my friends saw something a bit different”* — GhostStatus was made exactly for that, staying simple and discreet.
